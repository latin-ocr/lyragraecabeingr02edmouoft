ANACREON

Hephaestion HandbooA¹ qt* Aletre [on the Cratinean] : Eupolis
in the Exempt from Serrice has used this form of verse ver>⁷
irregularly ; sometimes he writes it thus . . . and sometimes
like this: ‘ And I always consorted with good sea-breams,’
so that it becomes a mixed choriambie like this of Anacreon ι

catalectic) of a tribrach and an iambus, so that there is
‘resolution' common both to t-he choriambic and to the
iambic³: ‘Light-winged‚‘ etc.

advantages may go hang, and your Love-God, Ο poet of
Teos, may ‘ fly by me,’ etc.

Light-winged Ι fly to Olympus to setch master
Love; for lo! he will not play with me as he used
to do, but he has seen that my beard is getting grey
now, and so he flies by me in the wind of his golden-

shining win gs.
