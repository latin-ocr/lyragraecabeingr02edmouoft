ANACREON

67
Etymoloyicum fllaynum: ἠπεροπευτής ‘a cheat': . . . eom-
pare (Od. ll. 364) . . . and Anacreon:

. wishes to be a deceiver to us.

681

The Same: ἀβακής ‘cl1i1dlike‚ innocent’ . . . so from
ἆβακὴς comes ἀβακῶ ‘to be childlike‚' as εἱνσεβώ ‘to be
pious' from εὐσεβής ‘pious'; there is also a form ἀβακίζω;
compare Anacreon ε

But as for me I hate all 'chose who have secretive
and uncompromising ways; I have learnt that you,

Megistes, are one of the childlike ones3

meaning quiet and not blustering.‘-'

Stobaeus Antholoqy [on death and its inevitability];
Anacreon z

My temples have grown grey and my crown bare
and white3 graceful youth is no longer with me,
and my beeth are the teeth of an old man. There
is left me but a short span of sweet life. And so
Ι often make my moan for fear of the underworld.
For dire is the dark hold of death, and grievous the
way down thither; and more, 'tis sure that once
down there’s no coming up.
