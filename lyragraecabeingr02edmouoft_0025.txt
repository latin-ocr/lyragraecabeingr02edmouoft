LY RA GRAECA

XANTHUS

Athenaeus Doctors at Diuum· [ou Hel-acles]: The more
modern poets, according to Megacleides‚ represent him as
going about merely in the guise of a robber, with cudgel,
lion-skin, and bow. This fashion was set by. Stesichorus of
Himera. The lyric poet Xanthus, who comes before Stesi-
chorus, as is testified by Stesichorus himself, does not repre-
sent him thus, if we may believe Megacleides, but as he
appears in Homer.

The Same: Stesichorus has drawn a great deal upon
Xanthus, for instance upon his Orestem as it is called.

Aeliau Hz'storz'cal Miscellasny: The lyric poet Xanthus,
who comes before Stesichorus of Himera, says that Electra
daughter of Agamemnon was originally called Laodice.
After the murder of her father, when Aegisthus had married
Clytemnestra and become king, and Laodice was likely to
die an old maid, the Argives gave her the name of Electra
because she remained a virgin.l
