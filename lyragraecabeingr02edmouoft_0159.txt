ANACREON

slippered maid3 but no, she hails from grand Lesbos,
and so she finds fault with my hair because it is white,
and goes gaping aster another ;

and says that Sappho replied to him thus ; ‘The hymn thou
hast uttered Ο golden-throned Muse, is that which the
illustrioris old Teian sang so delightfully from that noble
land of fair women ' ; but it is perfectly obvious, surely, that

Apollonius Syntaoe: The form χρῆμι was actually used for
χρῶ, like φημί, and the third person of it was χρῆσι, like
φησί, with the shortened form χρὴ ‘ it is right or necessary ' 3
compare [the form φή ‘ he says ⁹] in Anacreon :

For Targelius saith thou pitchest the quoit full
well.

Chrysippus Neqatlres: Anacreon has said :

Nor am Ι easy—going, nor yet pleasant to my
fellow-citizens.
