RACE

Aristotle Blwtorz‘c: Once when Simonides was offered too
small a see by the victor in the mule-ram, he refused to
write him an ode, on the plea that he could not bring himself
to write iu honour of mules. But when he offered him
sufficient pay, he took it and wrote :

Hail, ye daughters of storin-footed steeds 1

And yet they were also daughters of asses.

that thou wilt leave me to the birds and go to the deuee and
the winds?⁷] : The word μεταμώνιος is taken by some
authorities to mean ‘ vain and useless ' ; others say it means
properly ‘that which goes alost on both sides,’ quoting in
support of this Simonides:

And the dust from the wheel went up to the
winds.²
