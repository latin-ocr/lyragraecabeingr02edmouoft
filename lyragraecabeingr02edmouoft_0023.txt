LI FE OF SACADAS

Pausanias Description of Greece [on Argos]: A
little aside from the road to the Gymnasium called
Cylarabis and the gate there, stands the tomb ot
Sacadas, who was the first to perform the Pythian
tune at Delphi, and appears to have put an end to
the old feud between Apollo and the flute-players

which had persisted ever since the da)v of his contest
with the Silenus Marsyas}

The Same [on the founding of Messene by Epa-
meinondas]: That day was devoted to sacrifices and
prayers. On the following days they began to build
the wall round the city, and houses and temples
within it. The work was done to the accompani-
ment of no music but that of Boeotian and Argive
flutes, and there was keen conipetition between the
melodies of Sacadas and those of P1·0no1nus.2

Hesychius Glossatps .· Sacadeion :—a kind of musical
instrument.

Athenaeus Doclors a( Dinner: If you are ask-ed
the names of the warriors who were shut up in the
Wooden Horse you will perhaps be able to give one
οι· two, and even these you will hardly get from
Stesichorus’ account, but rather from the Taking
of Troy of Sacadas the Argive, who gives a very
long list.

who was the first to play the Pythian tune, and by fluting
made eease the God‘s hatred of the flute’ 2 cf. Ath. 14.
