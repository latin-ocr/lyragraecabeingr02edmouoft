SIMONIDES
210

[Longinus] On the Sublz‘me [on ‘ images⁷]: The imagery of
Sophocles is of supreme excellence where the dying Oedipus
goes to his grave amidst a gathering tempest, and also where,
as the Greeks set sail from Troy, Achilles appears to them over
his tomb3 and yet the latter image could hardly be more
vividly employed than it is by Simonides. But it is im-
practicable to quote every case in point.

211

Scholiast on the Iliad [‘Nastes and Amphimachus, the
glorious children of Nomion; aud he came moreover to the
war with a gold trinket like a girl ’]: The marginal mark is
because ‘ he ' refers to Amphimachus, though Simonides took
it of Nastes and because the meaning is not that he came
wit-h golden arms, as again Simonides would have it, but
with a gold ornament.

212

Scholiast on Piudar [‘ Among the Corinthians is the sweet—
breathed Muse’] : that is, they are musical ; for Corinth had
{cry ἒξιὶῃοιιε poets, including Arion, who is mentioned by

lmonl‹ es.

213

Scholiast on the Iliad [‘ daughter of Marpessa ‘]: Idas, the
reputed son of Aphareus but true son of Poseidon, by race a
Lacedaemonian, desiring a wife, went to Ortygia 111 Chalcis
and carried awa)v thence Euenus· daughter Marpessa, travel-
ling speedily with horses of Poseidon. Going forth to seek
his daughter, Euenus came to the river Lycormas in Aetolia
and there sank down; whence the Lycormas came to be
known as the Euenus. But nigh to Arene Idas was met by
Apollo, who laid hold on Marpessa, whereat Idas stretched
bow and began to fight him for his bride. Then became Zeus
judge between them, and bade Marpessa choose her man ;
when for sear Apollo would leave her when she grew old,
she chose Idas. Such is Simonides’ elaboration of the story.
