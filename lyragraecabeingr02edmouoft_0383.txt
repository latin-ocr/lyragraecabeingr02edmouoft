Palatina Antholoqgsz By the sanie (Simonides), on Cleis-
tlienes of Ceos who perished at sealz

Your tomb stands on no foreign soil, Cleisthenes,
but the doom of death overtaking you in the Euxine
Sea you have lost the sweet delicious homercoming

and returned no more to wave-washed Ceos.

148

The Same: Simonides, on Cleodeinus who was killed by
the Thracians:

Cleodemus too was led by Honour to a lamentable
death, the which he met in a Thracian ambuscade
by the mouth of the ever-flowing Theaerus‚2 and the
name of his father Diphilus has been made famous
by the deeds of his warrior son.

149

The Same : Simonides, on Nicodieus :

Each is hurt hythe loss of his own; the loss of
Nicodicus hurts both his friends and all this great
city.

150

The Same ε Simonides :

Some one rejoices that I, Theodorus, am ὀρθᾶς
another will rejoice over him3 we are all debts due
to Death.
