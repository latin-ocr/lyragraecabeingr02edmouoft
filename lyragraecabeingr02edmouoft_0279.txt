LIFE OF SIMONIDES

Plutarch Music: Pancrates usually avoided the
chromatio scale, though he used it occasionally, thus
showing that he did not avoid it from ignorant-e.
Indeed he tells us himself that he imitates the
musical style of Pindar and Simonides and, generally,
what is now called the ancient style.

Longinus the Rhetorician: Simonides and many
after him have pointed out paths to remembranee,
counselling us to compare images and localities in
order to remember names and events, but there is
nothing more in it than the concatenation and co-
observation of the apparently new with what is
similar to it.

Cicero On the Clziqf Good and {he Chicgf Eril: Is it
in our power to remember or to forget? When
Themistocles was once promised—by Simonides I
think it was—a handbook of mnemonics or guide to
remembrance, <1 should prefer,’ 116 exclaimed, ‘a
guide to forgetfulness3 sor I remember things I
would not and cannot forget what I would.' 1

Scholiast on Dionysius of Thrace [on the Alplia-
bet]: As for the inventors of the remaining eight
letters, namely the two long vowels, the three
double letters, and the three aspirateS, it is clear
that Simonides of Ceos invented the H, the Ω, the
Ξ and theJIJ, and Palamedes the Θ, the Φ, the X, and
the Z, though some authorities ascribe these last
four (?) to Epicharmus of Syracuse.

Plutarch Should Old Men Gorern .9 Simonides won
the chorus prize in his old age.2
