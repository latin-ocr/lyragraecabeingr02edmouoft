LIFE OF SIMONIDES

time, till at last, when the wondering Hiero asked
him to explain his strange bellaviour, he replied that
it was because the longer he thought about it, the
more obscure it became. I believe that the truth is
that Simonides, of whom tradition speaks not only
as a delightful poet but in all rcspects a wise and
learned man, despaired of the true answer because
so many subtle definitions occurred to him that he
could not decide among them.

Athenaeus Doctors (11¹ Dimzer: If we may believe
Chamaeleon, Simonides' niggardliness is a real fact.
For instance at Syracuse, where Hiero was in the
habit of sending him (111111Υ a portion of food, Simon-
ides used openly to 5611 most of it and keep only a
small part for hi1nself; and once, when he was asked
the reason, replied that he did so as a testimony to
Hiero’s munificence and his own moderation.l

Plutarch Life of Aratus: Even if it be a terrible
thing to deal thus with one's fellow-clansmen and
kinsfolk by anger, still in Simonides’ words ‘ 111 time
of necessity even harshness is sweet,' healing as it
were and restoring the spirit when it is sick and
fevered.

Timaeus quoted bs) tlze Scholiast on Pindar: Thus
Theron took umbrage on behalf both of his daughter
(Demarete) and her husband (Polyzelus), and made
war upon Polyzelus’ brother Hiero, advancing to the
Siciliau river Gela. . . . But not a blow was struck,
and the war came to nothing. For we are told that
the lyric poet Simonides came up in the nick of time
and reconciled the two kings.²
