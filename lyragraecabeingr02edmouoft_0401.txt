Palatine Α 7ztlzoloqy: A soldier's offering to Zeus ; Simonides:

Rest so, thou fine long ash, against the tall pillar,
abiding ever sacred to Zeus the Diviuer; for thy
bronze point is grown old and thou thyself art worn
out with much wielding in dreadful wal-,2

The Same: A dedication of the same (Simonides) :

Fifty and six, Simonides, were the bulls and the
tripods you had won ere you set up this iamet, even
so many were the times you mounted the splendid
chariot of glorious Victory sor teaching a delightful
choi-us of men.

1754

Aristides lec Eoetemporary Adclz'tion : For Simonides could

' say:

. and Ι declare that no man can rival in power
of memory Simonides the son of Leoprepes, eighty
years old though he be.

These are not the words of another man speaking of

Simonides, but his own, and moreover he adds the second
line to show that it is not a boast of his youthful prime.
