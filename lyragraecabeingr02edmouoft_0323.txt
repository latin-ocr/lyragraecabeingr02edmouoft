SIMONIDES
48

Plutarch Moml Virttcc: . . . just as Plato¹ employs the
simile of the draught-horses of the smil, the worscr horse
struggling against the better in the shafts, and disquieting
the driver, who has for ever to be earcfully holding then] and
tightening the rein,

lest he lose his hold 011 the crimson thongs
in Simonides’ phrase.

Athenaeus Doctors αἰ Βίηηεν [011 the Pleiads]: Simonides
calls them Peleiades 111 the following passage :

Now he that gives it thee³ is Hermes God of the
Games, Son of mountain Maia of the glancing eye,
who was the fairest of all Atlas’ seven violet-tressed
daughters dear, that are called the Heavenly
Peleiades.

Scholiast 011 Pindar [‘of Pisa⁷]: The first syllable of
Πίσας must be luade short to preserve the antistrophie
correspondeuee; both Pindar and Simonides do this.

Tzetzes Clzz‘lz'ads: . . . as Simonides writes of Orpheus:

Above his head there hovered birds innulnerable,
and fishes leapt clean from the blue water because

of his sweet music.
