LIFE OF SIMONIDES

Lucian Longerizfles: Simonides of Ceos lived to be
over ninety.1

Suidas Leucon : Sirnorri(lcs(31·d notice) t . . . There
was an Agrigentine (jeneral named Phoenix who, in
the course of a war with Syracuse, with cynical ruth-
lessness pulled down the tomb of Simonides and
made a bastion of the stones. At that spot the city
was taken.2 This story would seem to be confirmed
by Callimachus of Cyrene, who deplores the outrage
and makes this writer of deliglrtful v·erse sa)
‘ neither had he respect for the writino ther-eon
which declared that beneath las the son of Leoprepes
of Ceos' ; and a little further on: ‘nor §et had he
any fear of §ou br-,etlrren O Poly·deuces, who made
me, alone of all the ‹ uests, pass out ere the roof fell,
when the house at Cr· annon 0111116 down 1111115 upon
the mighty Scopadae.

Athenaeus Doclors at Dinner: Compare the author·
of the play called The Helols : ‘ It's old-sashioned to
sing Stesichorus, Alcman, or· Simonides 3 but we can
hear Gnesippus . . .

Scholiast on Aristophanes U'asps [‘ mind you take
up the catch properly’]: It was an old custom for
guests at table to continue where the first singer
left off. The guest who began held a spi-ig of bay
or myrtle and sang a lyric ofSimonides 01· Stesichorus
as far as 116 chose, and then lranded the sprig to
another, making his choice of a successor with no
regard to the order· in which the guests were seated.
