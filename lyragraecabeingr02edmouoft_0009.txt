PR E FA C E

IN introducing my second volume I have to thank
the Egyptian Exploration Society for their kind

v permission to include the fragment of the :S'ayings ο]

Simonides from the Hibeh Papyst'l' and the new frag-
ment of Ibyeus from the XVth Oxyrhynchus volume.

While I was making the Index Ι found that I had
omitted the second reference to Simonides in the
Paritm Chronicle, that recording his death at the age
of ninety in the year 468 1312, and the following
characteristic anecdote of Timocreon in the Περὶ
Κακιῶν of Philodemus, first rightly emended by
Wilamowitz in his Sappho und Simonides: ‘then
that conceited fellow Timocreon of Rhodes was
asked, as he came before the judge of the competi-
tion, where he hailed from, he replied: “ You shall
hear presently from the herald ”—a remark which
was passed on. However, his Castor-song proved so
little to the liking of his audience that the judge
stretched out his wand and nearly stopped him
before he had finished. This meant defeat3 and
when, as he withdrew, his questioner repeated
“Where do you hail from?‘' he replied “From
Seriphus.” '

Readers of Volume Ι should make the following
corrections-none of which, by the way, is necessi
tated by any lapse of Mr. Heinemann's admirable
staff: at p. 16 near the bottom read ἀριθμηθεῖσαν;
p. 45 ]. 5 632—629 13.C.; Alcman 1. 14 γεραιτάτος
35 μησαμένοι, 44 μωμέσθαι, 45 εἴμεν; Alcaeus l. 1.
