Scholiast on Pindar [‘how once before the walls of
Dardanus the Corinthians were thought to be turning the
issues of fights either way ³] ε The Corinthians distinguished
themselves on both sides at Τ1-1·,0 fig „rhting both nith the
Trojans and with the Greeks ..... And this is 11111 Simonides
savs:

Troy is not wroth with the men of Corinth,
Greeks though they be3

for they were allies of both sides.

Plutarch Em'le: If a man will but bear this in mind and
keep his head, 110 will prefer even to live in exile on an island
such as Gyaros or Cinaros . . . without losing heart or
lamenting or saying like the women in Simonides

The noise of the purple sea-waves about me holds
me fast.
