them and are fought for, as the phantom of Helen according
to Stesichorus was fought for by the warriors at Troy in
ignorance of the true Helen?

Zonaras Leucon: μάτην; for ματαίως ‘vainly,' an adverb
made from the feminine [noun]: compare Stesichorus ‘I
spake vanities.⁷

Aristides Oratz‘om: So much for that. ‘I will go seek
another prelude’ as Stesichorus says. Now I know that I,
like him, have to light with shadows. Those to whom my
words will apply are not present, and therefore in a sense
my words become vain and empty, although at the same
time it is certain that they will be true and to the point.
For it is obvious that the fault is not nor ever can, save
the mark, be mine, but rather lies with the entire and
inveterate apathy of these gentlemen themselves}

Plato Phaedrus: So it seems that Ι, my friend, must do
expiation. Now the precedent for expiation for sinners in
mythology goes back, not indeed to Homer, but to Stesichorus,
who when blinded for slandering Helen did not, like Homer,
wonder why, but like a true scholar recognised the reason for
what had befallen him and without more ado wrote ‘This
story' etc. . . . and having finished the Palinode as it is
called, immediately received his sight.

Ι spake vanities, and I will go seek another prelude.

This story is not true; thou wentest not in the
benched ships, thou camest not to the city of Troy.
