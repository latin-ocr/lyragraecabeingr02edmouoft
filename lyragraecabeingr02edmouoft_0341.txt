SIMONIDES

Cramer Inedz'la (Pa7·z's): νίκη ‘ victory’ :—- Apollonius son
of Archibius says that in stands for ἲ) ἕν’ εἴκει, that is ‘ that
which yields to 0ne‚’ being formed by the dropping of the
initial ε and syncope of the diphthong ει.1 Simonides alludes
to the etymology of it in the lines :

To one alone did the Goddess yield when she
mounted the chariot.
