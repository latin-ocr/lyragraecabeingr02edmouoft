Hephaestion Handbook Qs‘,][4rtre [on the Ionicum a minore] :
Of the trimeter the acatalectic . . . and in Anacreon:

May my due be granted me, to die3 for no other
deliverance from these troubles e'er can be.

523
Scholiast on Pindar [¹³2 golden-horned him] ’]: The poets
make a point of giving the female deer horns . . . and it is

the rule in Anacreon:

mild-eyed, like a little suckling fawn that is afraid
when he is left by his hol-ned mother in the wood.

Zenodotus changed κεροέσσης ‘ horned’ to ἐροέσσης ‘lovcly'
because it is recorded that the females have no horns like the
males ; nevert-heless all the poets give them horns.

53

Elymoloyicum illaquam :
Doorkeepers that fight are a mischief,

from the second Book of Anacreon; σινάμωροι ‘a mischief‚’
that is μεμορημένοι ‘destined to mischief‚' σίνεσθαι.
