Etymoloyiczcm Mammam: τραπεζίτης with the ι has the
ordinary meaning ‘banker' from τράπεζα ‘a table’; with
the diphthong ει it means ‘ one who stands beside the table,'
as in Homer ‘ the dogs beside the table,' τραπεζῆες from
τραπεζεύςς whereas the form with η, τραπεζήτης, used by
Ibycus in the phrase

the dogs about the table,
is parallel ‘co πλήων for πλείων ‘ more.’
