Aristides The Four Greal Athenium: Even Archi-
lochus, given as he was to libel, did not slander the
finest and most famous characters in Greece, but
people like Lycambes, Cheidus, and . . . Let us not
therefore surpass him, nor equal the miserable
Timocreon, but let us know how to speak well of

authorities Timocreon was a lyric poet who wrote
lampoons in iambic verse, while others say that he
was a bad inan who, when convicted by the Athenians,
went about saying‚ ‘ I'1n not their only victinr: there's
Pericles.’
