ANACREON
31

Athenaeus Doctors al Dimzcr [on thirst used metaphoric-
ally]: There is no desire more imperious than that of thirst.
And that is why Homer calls Argos ‘1nuch-thirsted-after³ as
being much desired owing to lapse of time [to the absenb
Greeks} And so too Sophocles says . . . and Anacreon:

You are dear, my lass, to strangers; so, as for me,

you may let me go thirsty.1

322

Hephaestion Hamlboolc ⁰f Metro [on the choriambic cata-
lectic]: some of these lines end with an amphibrach or
bacchius, for instance in the dimeter . . . and in the trimeter
compare Anacreon:

and fell in love with the tearful strife of war.

33

Athenaeus Doctors at Dinncr [on the large cup or jar called
κελέβη]; compare Anacreon:

And the serving-maid, holding the jar alost,
poured out the honey-sweet, mixed one in three.3

34

Scholiasb on Pindar [‘ For in those days the Muse was not
cove‘oous nor an hireling‚ nor were sweet tendenvoiced lays
sold of honey-lipped Terpsichore with their faces silvered.
o'er‘]: he speaks periphrastically of those who wrote for
money. The same sort of thing is said by Anacreon, and
possibly there is a reference ‘co it here. Anacreon says:

nor in those days did Persuasion shine all silver.
