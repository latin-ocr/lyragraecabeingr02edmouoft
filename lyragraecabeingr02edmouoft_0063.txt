Scholiast on Pindar Olslmpicms [ζ the fight with Cycnus
turned even the conquering Heracles about ']: The great
Heracles was turned about or gave ground in his fight with
Cycnus because Cycnus was set on by Ares. The cause of
Heracles' fighting him was his irnhospitalitffi for he lived in
the Pass of Thessaly and behezuled travellers in order to
build a temple to Apollo with their heads, and when Hei-acles
came that way was for serving him the same. Upon their
joining battle Heracles took to flight because Ares aided the
youthful Cycnus. But afterwards Her-acles killed him like
the rest of his enelnies. The story is told by Stesichorus in
the work called Cycnus.
