SIMONIDES

Proverbs (Cohn): ‘ The Carian tale':-mentioned by Si-
monides in his praises 01 a charioteer who won at Pellene
and received for his prize a cloak1 with which he kept off
the cold <for the . . . . games were held> at l’ellcn‘c in
winter. They say that a fisherman said on seeing an
octopus in the winter ‘If I don't dive I shall starve,' and
that this is the Carian tale.

Athenaeus Doctors at Dz'nncr [on octopuscs] ε The Dorians,
for instance Epicharmus, give it the ω, πώλυπος ‘ octop-us,’ and
Simonides says :
