LIFE OF STESICHORUS

tragedy Sophocles, among historialis Herodotus . . .
For it would be well-nigh impossible to find better
exponents than these of the art of composition.

Quintilian Elements of Oratoryz Among the nine
lyric poets Pindar stands easily first . . . The
strength of Stesichorus' genius is shown among
other things by his subject-matter. He sings of
great wars and famous chieftains, sustaining all the
weight of epie poetry with a lyre. Indced he gives
his characters the dignity that belongs to them both
in speech and action, and if he had only kept within
proper bounds might well have been counted a good
second to Homer ; but he is redundant and extrava-
gant, though indeed these are the faults of a well-
stored mind.

Suidas Leria-on : θέμις :--.Justice. Compare Aelian:
‘ If it is just for the man of Himera to raise his eyes
to Homer.’

Hermogenes Kinds qs Slyle: Herein Stesichorus
too appears to give peculial· pleasure by his frequent
nse of epithetS.

Athenaeus Πυθίων-3 al Dinner: Chamaeleon in his
treatise On *S'lesiclmrns declares that not only Homer's
verse was sung to music, but that of Hesiod and
Archilochus, and even that of Mimnermus and

phocylides.

Cicero Letlers 1¹0 Atticus: If this eompact with me
is not being keptst then I hug myself to think how
our gallant Jerusalemite plebeian-maker ² will know
what a fine return he has made me for my brilliant
orations in his behalfi to which you may now expect
a super-palinode.
