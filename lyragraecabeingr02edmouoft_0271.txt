LIFE OF SIMONIDES

Plutarch Dinner-Talule I’roblems: One evening
ov ei the wine, u hen the poet Simonides saw a ι uest
sitting absolutely, silent, he exclainicd ‘ lf 5ου re a
fool, ni) good sir, Jou’ re wise in xxv-hat §ou do;a11‹l
if v'ou re wise, jou re a f.ool’

The Same lec (r'lory of Alhens: Simonides calls
‘painting silent poetry and poetry painting that
speaks’3 sor the actions which painters depict as
they are being performed, words describe after they
are done.l

Aristotle in Stobaeus Atzllzologlls : We are told that
when Simonides was asked what was meant by good
birth, he replied ‘ ancestral wealtli.‘

Michael Psellus The Fzmclion of Daemons: . . .
According to Simonides the word is the image of the
thing.

Aristides On the Ert'empore Adzlition [how epitaphs
prove that states are guilty of self-praise]: So 5ου
may laugh at the fallen [for praising themselves] and
call them underground babblers who cannot keep
still; and some disciple of Simonides will retort
‘you are more dead above ground, my good man,
than those are below it?

Theon First Com-se in. Grammar: . . . Simonides
gives harmful advice when he says we should play
all our lives and never be entirely in earliest.

Aris-totle Plzzssics:1n time ev erything coines into
existence and passes out of it; and that is 5ν115 some
writers2 called Time wisest of things3 though Paron
the Ρ5 thagorean 5355 it is soolishest, because we also
forget in it—which indeed is more correct.
