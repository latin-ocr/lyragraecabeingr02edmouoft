high-gated, for all ’tis so glorious a theme3 nor
shall 1 recount the proud valour of the Hemes, the
Heroes so noble whom the hollow ships with theii-
nailed sides brought unto Troy for her mischief, of

of Atreus.

On such tasks may the well-skilled voice of the
Muses of Helicon enter, but never a mortal alive

Menelaus from Aulis ‘across the Aegean Sea from
Argos to Dardany nurse of horses, and how came
those brazen—targeted wights, the sons of the
Achaeans, of whom the most eminent in battle
came swift-foot Achilles and the great and

courageous Aias son of Telamon . . .
