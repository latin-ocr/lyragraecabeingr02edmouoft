Cicero Tusculan Dispzclalions: What extravagant
things Alcaeus writes on the love of youths! and
as for Anacreon, his poetry is erotie from beginning

sulpassed in this mattei by Ibyeus of Rhegium.
And the love of all these poets w 13 the sensual& love

Abhenaeus Doctors at [ηήηεν [011 love in the poete] : And
Ibycus of Rhegium ories aloud z

’Tis but in Spring the quince-trees of the Maids'
holy garden grow green with the watering rills from
the river, and the vine-blossoms wax 'neath the
mantling sprays of the vineS; but for me Love’s
awake the year round, and like the Northwind from
Thrace aflame with the lightning, coines with a rush
from the Cypriam, with shrivelling frenzies bale-ful
and bold, and with masterful power shake& me to
the bottom of my beart.
