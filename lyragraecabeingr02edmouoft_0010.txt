PREFACE

“Ἀπ()λλον, 2 ὃν, 5 Βέλφοις, 15 Βελφίκοις, 01· better,
perhapS, Βελφάοις, comparing Εζιρηοίοέἰσιιηι ssIagnum
200. 24 and a Thessalian inscription published in
the *lIiileilemgen for 1896 p. 2483 at the bottom of
p. 323 delete the word j'oolozole3 at p. 318 l. 9 read
ἀνθρώποις, l. 10 ἀργυροῖς, fr. 27, l. 4 γεινομένοισιν as in
the Classical Review for 1916 p. 103, fr. 86 παίσαν
κακοτάτων πεδέχοισαν. In the Proceeclz'ngs of tlte
Cambridge Plzilological Socielsy for 1922, p. 14, I have
proposed the following reading of the passage be-
ginning at l. 46 of Alcman’s Partheneion: ἒκπρέπης
τὼς ὥπερ αἴ τις Ι ἐν δρόσοις στάσειεν ἵππον Ι παγὸν
ἀῗεθλοφόρον καναχάποδα Ι ταῖς ἐπιπετριδίων ὀνάγρων,
comparing Aeschylus' ἐπιτυμβίδιος, Strabo 568 τὰ
τῶν Λυκαόνων ὀροπέδια ψυχρὰ καὶ ψιλὰ καὶ ὃναγρό-
βοτα, and Aeschylus Agamemnon 141 with Callima-
chus Hecale col. 2 l. 4, and supposing the corruption
of ὀνάγρων to have proceeded thus: ὀνάγρων-
ὀναίρων-ὀνείρων, with which we may compare ὄναρ
and Hesychius ἅναιρον· ὄνειρον Κρῆτες.

The newly discovered fragments of Lesbian
poetry are reserved for the appendix to Volume III.

I may be allowed to add that the one wholly
unfavourable criticism published of my first volume
will be found to be fully answered partly in the
Classical Reviem for November 1922 and partly in
the above volume of the Cambridge Philological
Society’s I'roceedings.
