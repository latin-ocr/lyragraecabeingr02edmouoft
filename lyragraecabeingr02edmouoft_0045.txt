STESICHORUS

ι) 3

A).

Athenaeus Doctors at Dinncr : ¹ Cakes, according to ›Seleu-
cus, are first mentioned by Panyassis in his Acwzms ω’ llic
Human Sacrzjfices in Eyypt, in which he says that they offered
many a cake and many a capon, although Stesichorus or
Ibycus had written before him in the work called Funeml
Games:

Bring your maid-gifts‚ sesame-cakes, groats, sweet-
oil cakes, cakes of all sorts, and with them yellow
honey.2

Note here that there is excellent authority for ascribing
that poem to Stesichorus rather than Ibycus, namely the
poet Simonides where he says iu a passage about Meleager
[and the speaizthrowing] ‘So Homer and Stesichorus sang
to the peoples.’ For in the poem in question Stesichorus
says:

In the leap the victor was Amphiaraus, and in the
javelin Meleager.
