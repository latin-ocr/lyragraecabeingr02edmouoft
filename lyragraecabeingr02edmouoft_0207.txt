ANACREON
108

Etymoloyicwn llsaqnmn κινοίτη ‘ scilnitar' : the form is
κινάκης in Sophocles. The form used by Anacreon (is not
parallel, for it) is written without the ι (‘subscript’); there
has been ecthlipsis or squeezing-out of the ι, and with erasis
of ωα the result is τώκινάκῃ

with his scimitar
as in ὤπολλον for ὦ Ἄπολλον ‘ Ο Apollo.’

Etymoloyz'cum Sorbonicnm ἀστρέβη· . . . in Anacreon lt
occurs in the form ἀστραφή
saddle
and is used of a chair-saddle in which people sit securely.

Hesychius alos-sams αὐτάγητοι : ‘ self-admirfflg, sels-marvel-
ling ' (women) ; Ion in the Alcmena. Some authorities say it
means

stubborn
and it is used so by Anacreon.

111

Elymoloqz‘cmn Jlaynum ἐσυνῆκεν; Alcaeus uses this form,
and Anacreon ἐξυνῆκεν

he understood,
with pleonastic augment.

1121

Scholiasta on Aristophanes: Because of its warming the
breast the phrase ‘to put the corslet on’ is used meaning
‘ to be drunk‚' and people slightly drunk were called

top-corsleted

an expression used by Anacreon. It is Attic.
