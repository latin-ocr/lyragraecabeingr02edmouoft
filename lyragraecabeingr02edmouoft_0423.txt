SIMONIDES

Plut. Life of Lyczoryus: Nevertheless‚ although History is
at a loss, we will try to base our account of the man upon
such of the recorded facts as are least controverted or have
the support of the best authorities. According to the poet
Simonides, the father of Lycurgus was not Eunomus, but
Lycurgus and Eunomus were sons of Prytanis. This is
contrary to most of the authoritieS, ete.

The Same Life of Ayesz'la'zcs: And this is why Simonides is

from the outset.

Scholiast on Pindar [‘on the mother's side from Asty-

crickets of that country do not chirp.³
