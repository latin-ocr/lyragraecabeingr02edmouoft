SIMONIDES

night-bound in the black darkness 1 of a dismal
brass-ribbed bark, and reckest not of 1116 salt of 1116
passing wave so thick on thy hair, nay, nor the cry
of the wind, lying in thy purple swathings with thy
pretty face against 1116. For if 1116 dire were dire to
thee, thou ‘dst lend thy little ear 10 what I say.
So sleep thou on, my baby, as I pray the sea may
sleep and our great great woe may sleep3 and come
some change 10 us, Father Zeus, of thee. And what-
soever of my prayer 116 overbold and wrong, do thou

forgive it me.'
