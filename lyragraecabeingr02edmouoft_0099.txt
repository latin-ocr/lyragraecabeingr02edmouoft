IBYCUS

21

Scholiast on Plato Parnzcnz'dcs [⁶1 must give way’ said
Parinenides; ‘and yet I feel I resemble the old racc—horse
about to compete in a chariot—race and trembling at the
prospect because he knows what it means, to whom Ibycus
likens himself when he complains that at his time of lise he
is made to take part in love against his will] : The words of
the l) rie poet 1111 cus are these·

Y et again will Lov 0 ex e me tendeil) fi 0111 beneath
dark brows and cast me with manifold mag ic into
the hopeless net of the Loxe Goddess. 1 511 e‘n 1115
approach makes me ’crcmble like an old champion-
horse of the chariot-race when he draws the swift

car all unwillingly to the contest.
