Simonides Fragment 61 :

For thus have Homer and Stesichorus sung to the

peoples.

Plutarch llsusic [on Linus5 Thamyris, Demodocus,
etc.]: The manner of the poenis of the aforesaid
poets was not free and without metre, but like those
of Stesichorus and the older lyric poets who made
epic verse and put it to music.

The Same: &Vc learn that the Harmatian Nome
was the work of Olympus from the treatise of
Glaucus on The Ancient Poene, where we are also
informed that the poet imitated by Stesichorus oi
Himera was neither Orpheus nor Terpander nor
Archilochus nor Thaletas, but Olympus, and that
Stesichorus made use of the Harmatian Nome and
the dactylic form, which according to some authori-
ties comes from the Orthian or High—pitched Nome.

The Same: Innovations in rhythm are ascribed to
Alcman, and also to Stesichorus, in both cases with-
out departing from the beautiful manner.

Suidas Lat-icon: Sapphot— . . . flourished in the
42nd Olympiad (3.0. 612-609), in the time of
Alcaeus, Stesichorus,1 and Pittacus
