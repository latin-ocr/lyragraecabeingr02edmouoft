fame and fortune of their fathers by gathering in the
new town the ancestral embellishments of the old.
Among these was a number of bronze statues, in-

town and the river upon which it stood, and also a
statue of Stesichorus as an old man bending over a
book, a masterpiece of art, they tell us, representing
a man who dwelt indeed at Himera, but enjoyed

Pliny Natural Hisloaeys [on the song of the nightin-

of his sentence, heard a man perform with some
skill a song of the lyric poet Stesichorus, and begged
him to teach it him that he might sing it before it
was too late, and when the music-ian asked him what
could be the use ofit replied ‘I want to die knowing
something more.'2
