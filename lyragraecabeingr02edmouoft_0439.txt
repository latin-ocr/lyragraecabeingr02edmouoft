Scholiast on Aristophanes Askar-niam [·'Then in wrath
Olympiam Pericles thundered and lightened and eonfounded
all Greece, made laws written like drinking-songs and told
the Megarians to remain neither ashore nor at market nor at
sea nor on the mainland’]: That is, in imitation of the com-
poserof drinking—songs. The lyric poet Timocreon of Rhodes
wrote a drinking-song like this attacking Wealth, of which
the beginning is :

Oh how Ι wish, blind God of Riches, you were to
be seen neither ashore nor at sea nor on the main-

land, but dwelt by Acheron’s bank in Tartarus 2 For

youlgt is that are the cause of all the evil of the
wor .
