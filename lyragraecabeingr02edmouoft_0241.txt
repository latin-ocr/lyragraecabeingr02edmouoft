LASUS

1 ΗΥΜΝ To THE HERM10N1AN Demersit

Athenaeus Doctors (lc Dlnncr [on the Aeolian ‘ inode ']: The
Aeolian character, on the other hand, is one that gives itself
airs and does the grand, and indeed is inclined to he eoneeited
—whieh agrees with their horse-breeding and their ways of
entertaining guests— 3 there is no real wiekedness in it, but
it is high-spirited and sels—confident. And that is why the
Aeolians are so given to wine, women, and luxui-inus living.
Thus it is that they have the character of [he mode known
as Hypodorian, which is tho sanie, according to Heracleides,
as what they called Aeoliam as indeed Lasus of Hermione
calls it in his Hyinn to the Hermionian Demeter, which
begins thus:

Demeter I sing and the Maiden that was the wife
of Clymenus, leading a honey-voiced hymn by way
of the deeprnoted mode Aeolian3

though this is always sung as Hypodorian.

The Same [on poenis written without s]: According to
Heracleides of Pontus in the the 3rd hook of his Treatise on
Μιιείσ, Lasus’ Hymn to the Hermionian Demeter also is
asigmatie—the hymn which begins ‘ Demeter I sing)
