The Same: According 10 Stesichorus the Sun crosses the
ocean 111 a cup, and 111 1116 same cup Heracles passed over

The Same: Of the Sun’s passage to his setting upon a cup
we thus learn from Stesichorus :

Then went Helios son of Hyperion down into his ⁷

golden goblet for to cross the Ocean and come to γ

1116 deeps of sacred murky night, unto mother and
wedded wife and children dear; and the son of
Zeus 4 went afoot into the laurel-shaded grove.
