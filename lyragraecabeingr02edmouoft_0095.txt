Palaline Antlzolog'zs: On the lyric poet Ibycus;
anonymous :

I sing of the end of slioaly Italia, of Rhegium
which tasteth ever of the water of Sicily, because
Ibycus that lover of the lyre, that lover of lads, was
buried by her, his many pleasures over, beneath a
leafy elin-trec, where much ivy and a bed of white
reed make a covering for liis g1·ave.⁶

Aristophanes ’171631110ρῆονὶαειικασε It is particularly
unrefined of a poet to be bom-ish and unkempt.
Just think how master-cooks of music like the great
Ibycus and old Anacreon of Teos wore the cap of
luxury and danced like this [i. e. in the Ionian way}
