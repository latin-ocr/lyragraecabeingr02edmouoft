‘cattle-lifting’; compare Homer Iliad 677 ‘A mightily
abundant prey did we drive together out of the plain⁷;

Plutarch Amatorius : So true is it that the genuine love'is
of the male, not ‘shining with ‹lesi1·e‚⁷ as Anacreon says of
that of the female⁷ nor ‘gleaming with ungue11tS‚’ but of
plain aspect and not spoilt in the schools of the philosopher-5.

e.g. . . . shining with desire and gleaming with
unguents
