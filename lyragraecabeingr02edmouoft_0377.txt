SIMONIDES
137

Palatina Anthela-w: [Simonides] on one Lion who was
guarded by a lion of marble z

Ι am the most valiant of beasts, even as he whom
now 1 guard in stone astride this grave was most
valiant of 1nen; if Lion had had my name without
my nature, then had Ι never set foot upon this
tomb.l

Anonymous Mythographer: For it is not true that the
soul leaves the body, but rather that the body leaves the
soul. Hence both the poet Simonides . . „³ and Statius to
the same effect in Book VIII of the Thebaid: ‘I hate the
limbs and this fragile usage of a body that deserts the soul.⁷

e. g. . . . For the body of such a man as this leaveth
Ι at death his soul, not his soul the body.

Thucydides Hlstory: Aiantides the son of Hippoclus tyrant
of Lampsacus soon after received Hippias’ daughter Arche-
dice in marriage, her Athenian father giving her to a
Lampsacene because he knew that the rulers of that city had
great influence with king Darius. Archedice's tomb is at
Lampsacus, and bears the following inscription :

This dust covers Archedice the daughter of
Hippias the foremost Greek of his ti1ne; daughter,

wife, sister, and mother, of despots, she lifted not up
her heart unto presumptuousneSS.
