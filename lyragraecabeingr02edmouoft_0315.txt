39 Fon GLAUCUS OF CARYs'rUs

Lucian On Belmlf cf the Pz'ctzcres: But think how a famous
poet praised Glaucus saying:

Neithcr the might of Polydeuces would have
lift hand against him, nay, nor the iron child of

Alcmena.3

Do you see to what Gods he likened him, or rather declared
him to surpass? And neither was Glaucus himself offended at
being praised at the expense of the Gods who are guardians
of athletes‚ nor did those Gods punish either Glaucus or the
poet for impiety. Far from it, both of them received honour
and glory from all Greece, the one for his strength and the
other for no poem that he wrote more than for this!
