TYNNICHUS

Llrss

Ptolemaeus Hephaestion in Photius Library : It is
said that upon the death of Demetrius of Scepsis a
copy of Tellis was found on his pillow, and similarly
that the Diving women of Alcman (?)1 was found
beside Tynnichus.²

Porphyrius On Abstaz'ozz'nq from Animal Food: then
Aeschylus was asked hy the Delphians to write a Pae¹1n to
A pollo, he ls said to hav e replieil that Ty nnichus h ul written
an excellent one alreadx and that any paean he micht write
would be at as great a ‹lis:'idxanta‹O e as a modern statue in
comparison with an old one; for Othe latter though simply
executed was considered (livine, while the modern statne
might be marvelled at for its elaborate workmanship but
gave less conviction as a representation of the deity it
portrayed.

Plato Ion: Since, then, the many noble things the poets
eompose and say on any subject, like you on Homer, are not
the result of art bnt of a divine dispensation, they are able
to aequit themselves well only in a kind to which they are
directed by the Mus-e, be it the dithyramb, the eulogy, the
(lance-song, the «spic, or the iambic3 in all other kinds their
performance is second-rate. . . . A good example of what I
mean is seen in Tynnichus of Chalcis, who never composed
an ything worth rememberin g bnt the Paean sung everywhere,
which is well-nigh the finest lyric poem ever written, truly,
as he himself calls it,

an invention of the Muses
