SIMONIDES
140

Palatino Anflzoloyy : Simonides z

Ι shall remember3 for she that lies here cannot
lie unnamed, to wit Xanthippe the beauteous wife
of Archenautes and grandchild's grandchild of that
Periander who gave the word of sovereignty to them
of towered Corinth.l

The Same: By the same (Simonides), on Megacles:

When I behold the tomb of Megacles, I pity you,
poor Callias.2

142

The Same: Simonides, on one that was shipwreeked on
Geraneia and the Scironian Roeks :

Skyey Geraneia, thou evil cmg, Ι would thou
lookedst 011 Ister far away and upon Scythia’s
distant Tanais, and that the Scironian Cliff dwelt
not beside the sea by which Iphimenes sailed about
the rock Moluris; but alas! he is a chill corpse in

the deep, and this empty tomb proclaims a bitter
seafaring.

¹ the speaker is apparently the statue of a Siren or the like
² Callias: his father, son of Hipponieus ‘ Ammon' of the
Alcmaeonidae?
