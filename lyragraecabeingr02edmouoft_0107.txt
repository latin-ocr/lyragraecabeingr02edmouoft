IBYCUS

20 1
Old Etymoloyicum fllaynum 197: Cyaras z—Il))·cus:
nor Cyaras the general of the Medians

Some authorities ‹lerive this from Cym-ezras by shortening,
others from Cym (Υ) ; if it comes from the compound Cyna-aras
the α is not pleonastic‚ but if it comes from C'yra with
pleonasm of α . . .

Herodian ll'ords without Poerallelz τάφοςε . . . but when
it is used for ‘ aniazement’ it is neuter3 compare [Homer]:
‘ She sat for a long while silent, for amazement had come to
her heart.⁷ But perhaps this instance fails to convince.
Ibycus, at any rate, has distinguished tho gender in his first
Book, where he follows Homer very closely :

sat for a long time beside him fixed in amazement

22

Scholiast on Apollonius of Rhodes Argonautica [Ἰ burn
with love of the fair Endymion’]: Ibycus in his first Book
makes Endymion king of Elis.

Strabo Geoqraphgs [on islands that- have become peninsula&
etc.]: On the island that lies off Syracuse there is now a
bridge connecting it with the mainland where there was
formerly a mole, according to Ibycus, of ‘selected' 01· un-
hewn masonry, which he calls ‘picked out’ [that is, builded].

Scholiast on Pindar [⁴ Ortygia, scion of famous Syracuse '] ε
Ortygia‚once an island, later became joined to the mainland ;
compare Ibycus 2

to ’che dry land builded hy mortal hands where
once dwelt the flesh-gnawing fishes and the sea-
snails
