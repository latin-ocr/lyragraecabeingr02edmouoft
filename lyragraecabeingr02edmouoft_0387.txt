The Same : On Brotaehus : Simonides :

I that lie here am Brotaehus of Gortyn, a Cretan
born, and I came not for this but on business.

The Same: Simonides on himself: Simonides, finding a

eorpse on a certain island, buried it and wrote this epitaph
over the grave :

Grant, O God of Guest and Host, that those who

slew me shall meet with like fortune, but those who
put me under the sod may enjoy a happy life.
The ghost of the buried man now appeared to Simonides and
urged him not to set sail. His fellow-travellers refusing to
take the warning, Simonides stayed behind alone and was
saved (from the death which overtook them). XVhereupon
he put over the grave the following lines :

This is he that saved the life of Simonides of
Ceos, he who though dead yet showed his gratitude
'co the living.
