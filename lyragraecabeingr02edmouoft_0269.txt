LIFE OF SIMONIDES

Scholiast on tlte passage: . . . By this he implies
the possession of great riches, so as to bc able to seed
many retainers. ‘ But all the same,' says he, ί their
wealth would have been of no avail for the preserva-
tion of their glory, had their praises not been sung
by Simonides.’ . . . The Scopads were Crannonians
by birth, and Crannon is a city of Thessaly, birth-
place of Scopas son of Creon and Echecrateia. Com-
pare Simonides in the Dirges . . . By ‘the great
Ceian' he means Simonides, who wrote victory-songs
and dirges for the aforesaid great Thessalians.

Plutarch On Listening to Poetrzs: And that is w 1η
when they asked Simonides wli) the Thessali-ms
were the only people 116 never che-ared, he ieplied

‘'Tliey are too great duncesff

Diogenes Laertius Lires of the Philas-oplzers: Ac-
cording to Aristotle in the 3rd Book of his Treatisc
on Poelry (fr. 65) . . . Antimenidas and Alcaeus
had a feud with Pittacus, Sosibius with Anaxagoras,
and Timocreon with SimonideS.¹

Plato Republz'c (SOCRATES and Potm1fflcnns): What
do you say, said I, that Simonides rightly says about
justice ?—-That justice is to give every man his due.

Stobaeus Anllzology: Simonides z—XVhen a friend
of his once told Simonides that he was hearing a
great deal of slander about him, 116 replied ‘ Be so
good as to stop defaming me with your ears.'

Plutarch Garruliw: In all things and for all these
reasons we ought to bear in mind the saying of
Simonides, that he had often repented speaking but
had never repented holding his tongue.
