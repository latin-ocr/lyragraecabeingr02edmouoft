ANACREON

name for happiness and longevity, particularly their rulers ;
and it was for this reason Anacreon said ε

Ι would not have Amalthea’s horn, nor even a
reign of alhundred years and fifty over all-happy
T artessus ;

Herodotus adds the nanie of the king in question,
Arganthonius.

Athenaeus Βορέω-8 αι’ Dinncr [on sweet smells]: And the
wise Anacreon says ε

Come haste thee to anoint with unguent a bosom
as hollow as a cave ; 2

exhorting him to anoint the bosoni, in which lies the heart,
clearly because the heart is soothed by sweet scents.

10³

Etymoloyz‘cum illaquam ε ι’ἐνωται [for νενόηται] ‘ he is minded
. and the participle in Anacreon z

but he, being lofty-minded

or ‘proud' . . .

AThe Same: Δεύνυσυς, Deunysusz—Dionysus. Compare
’ nacreon:

and oft loud-shouting Deunysus

The ι becoming ε gives Deonysus, which is the Samian
form—and by contraction Deuuysus, like Theodotus Theudotus.

¹ the possessor of A.'s horn got all he wished ² the
idea is ‘ as deep-breasted as a woman ’ ³ cf. Fav. 298
