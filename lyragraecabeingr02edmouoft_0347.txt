numbers being compensated by the narrowness of the strait‚
which both prevented the Barbarians from using their whole
force at once and caused their ships to fall foul of one another,

which outshone any deed of the sea whether Greek or
Barbarian, alike in the fire and courage of the men and in the
genius of their leader.

Glaucus, made unto themselves a right noble witness
of their deeds by honouring the gold that is in the
sky 33 and that gold doth increase and spread wide

He has not said this iu any work for which he trained a
chorus at Corinth nor in any poem written in honour of that
city, but has simply recorded their deeds in an elegiae poem.
