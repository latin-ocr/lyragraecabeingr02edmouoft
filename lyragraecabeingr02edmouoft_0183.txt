ANACREON
63

Hephaestion Handboolc of Matre [on ‘unconnectable‘
metres]: A notable composite too is thc double two-ansl-a-
half-foot line known as the cncomiologic, which consists of
a two—and-a-half-foot dactylis: and an iambic of the same
-length‚ used by Alcaeus . . . and by Anacreon in several
poems, for instance

Warman Ares loves a staunch fighter.

641

Elymologyicum lllaynum ε ᾗμετέρειος is a possessive adjective
meaning ‘ belonging to what is ours‘ ; it was used by
Anacreon thus :

neither one of our land nor beautiful

65

Scholiast on Pindar [ζ when they set about to make a
crown for Ilium ’]: ‘crown' is metaphorical for ⁴ wall' ; for
the walls of a city are as it were its crown ; so also Anacreon:

But alas! the crown of the city is destroyed.

66

Choeroboscus on Hephaestion [on the combination of two
syllables not separated by a consonantl: Heliodorus in his
Introduction says that even three syllables coalesce into one,
for instance this double two-anda-half line which resembles
an elegiae :

Asteris, neither I love you nor ApelleS.

For it is not an elegiae really, but the first part is a
dactylic and the second an iambic, since it has two iambic
feet and a syllable, so that the words φιλέω οὔ together make
a short and one long.
