Palatina Antholoqy: [Bacchylides or Simonides 2];

Oft have the Dionysian Seasons shouted with joy
for the ivy-dight dithyramb at the dances of the
tribe Acamantis‚ and shaded the shining locks of
skilful singers with ribbons and with choice 1·oses;
but they who have made this tripod to be witness
to their Bacchic prize are the nien who were taught
by Antigenes3 and right well did Ariston of Argos
nurse with outpou1·ings of the sweet breath of his
pure flute the delightful voice of Athenians‚ who
were led in their ring of melody by Hipponicus son
of Struthon from the chariot of the Graces, the
which have bestowed upon his men name and fame
and splendid victory by aid of the God and the
violet-crowned Muses.
