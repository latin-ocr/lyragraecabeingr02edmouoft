TIMOCREON

Lm:

Suidas Learicon: Timocreon :-Of Rhodes, a play-
wright of the Old Comedy. He was at enmity
with the lyric poet Simonides, and also with the
Athenian Themistocles, of whom he composed a
censure in the form of a song. He wrote among
other things a comedy directed against the same
Themistocles and the lyrist Simonides.1

Athenaeus Doclors at Dinner [on gluttony] : Timo-
creon the poet of Rhodes and five-event champion
was both toper and trencherman, as is shown by the
epitaph :²

Thy guttling o'er, thy tippling done,

Thou'rt lying still, Timocreon.
And indeed Thrasymachus of Chalcedon informs
usin one of his Introductions that when Timocreon
became the guest of the Persian King he took every
advantage of his table3 once, when the King asked
what he was feeding himself up for, he replied, ⁶ To
give innumerable Persians a sound tln·asliing‚' and
the next day defeated a large number of them one
by one, and then stood beating the air, explaining

to his wondering host that he had all these blows
to spare if anybody would come on.3
