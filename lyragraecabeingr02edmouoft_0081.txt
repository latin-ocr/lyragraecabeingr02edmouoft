STESICHORUS

72

Philodemus Music: True to his name Terpander, Gladdener
of Men, pleased the judges of the contests; the Spartans
quelled the disorders by choosing not to disohey the oracle,
and possibly also because they were prevailed on by words
of persuasion. Nevertheless, the story of Stesichorus is
incorrect, and with regard to Pindar we do not know if what
he did was successful in puttinga stop to the party strife.
But if either was the fact, it was done rather by words
poetically arranged than by poetry, and they would have
met with even greater success if they had employed prose.

Scholiast on the Iliad [ί Even so may your bones lie with
mine in the same urn, to wit the gold one of two handles
which thy lady mother gave thee ⁷]: Dionysus, having enter-
tained Hephaestus at Naxos, received from him a golden urn,
aud afterwards, when he took refuge from the pursuit of
Lycurgus in the sea aud was kindly received by Thetis, gave
the

fire-God fashioned urn

to her, and she made a gift of it to her son Achilles, to 1 e
the urn of his burial. The story is told by Stesichorus.

and with them Stesichorus aud Pindar, who bewail in
eclipses that ‘the most manifest of stars is stolen awny’ and
‘noonday mado nighn’ and declaro that ‘the beam of the
sun is the path of darkness.'
