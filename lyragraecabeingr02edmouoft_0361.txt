SIMONIDES

Now it is said that the poet used to stay at Carthaea ¹
while training the choruses there, and the training-school
being high up by the temple of Apollo and far from the sea,
all the chorus-men, including the pupils of Simonides, fetched
their water from the spring in the lower part of the tou 11.
This they did by means of a jackass which the)v oulled Epeius
after the Epeius who carries water for the Atreidae in the
Trojan story, a story which was depieted on the walls of the
temple of Apollo near which they were training. . . . Now
it was arranged that any chorister who came late should pro-
vide the jackass with a quart of barley. This is what is
referred to in the verses 3 he who would not be winner of the
cricket’s prize means he who would not [learn to] sing‚2 tho
son of Panopeus means the jackass, and the ‹linum- the quart
of barlev.

of the face, makes the voice even more ugly and unpleasant
than it would otherwise be.
