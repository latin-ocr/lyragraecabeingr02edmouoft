Introduction lo Theocritus 16 (ef. 1. 10): The story
goes that Simonides kept two boxes, the 0116 for sees

and opened before 111111, and 6111 short his iinportunity

fee-box full.3

Theocritus: Many indeed were the bondinen
earned their monthly ineed in the houses of
Antiochus and King Aleuas, many the calves that
went lowing· with the horned kine home to byres of
the Seopads, and ten thousand were the fine sheep
that the shepherds of the plain of Crannon watched
all night for the hospitable Creondae: hut onee all
the sweet wine of their life was in the great cup,
onee they were embarked in the harge of the old
man loathsome‚ the joyanee and pleasure of those
things was theirs no more: and though they left
behind them all that great and noble wealth, they
had lain among the vile dead long ages unremem-
bered, had not the great Ceian eried sweet varied
lays to the strings and famoused 1116111 111 posterity,
and had not the eoursers that came home to them
victorious out of the Games aehieved the honour and
glory which calied the poet to 1115 task.
