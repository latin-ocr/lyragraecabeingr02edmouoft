SIMONIDES
1211

Strabo Geofsraplzy : Opus is the mother-city of the Loerians,
witness the inscription on the first of the five pillars eom-
memorating Thermopylae, the one near the general grave :

Of those who died for the sake of Greeee against
the Medes these are mourned by Opus the mother-
city of the Locrians of the upright laws.

1222

Palatina Αηιῖιοῖοςιῃε The Same (Simonides) on those who
died with Leonidas the Spartan:

Famous are they this earth doth cover, slain here
with thee, Leonidas king of spacious Lacedaemon,
when they fought and abode the strength of many

arsid mgny an arrow and swift-footed horse and man
o Me ia.

123³

Dio Chrysostom Oratz'ons: And they (the Corinthi-ans)
fought, the best at Salamis and were the prime cause of the
victory. For I prefer the witness not of Herodotus but of
their tomb and of Simonides, who wrote the following
epitaph on the Corinthians who were-buried at Salamis :

Once, O stranger, we lived in the well-watered
{itladel o4f Corinth, but now we dwell in Ajax’ isle of
a amis.
