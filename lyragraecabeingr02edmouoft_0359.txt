SIMONIDES

Athenaeus Doctum at Dinner: With regard to hares
Chamaeleon relates in his book 011» Simonides that when
supping once with Hiero, the poet was left ouh when the
jugged hare was Served to the guests, whereupon as Hiero
was sending him some, he improvised the following parod3⁷ : ¹

Wide though it was, it could not reach to me.

113, 114

The Same: Verses of 1110 nature of riddles were eomposed
also by Simonides, if we may believe Chamaeleon of Heraclea
111 1113 book on that poet ; let 1110 quote these:

The father of the wayward kid,

The child of eve upon each lid,

With the fell fish lies jowl by cheek 5
And so my quest is still to seek.

For they refuse their aid to lend

Lord Bacchus' butcher-knight ’co mend.

Some explain it thus . . . Others say it was the custom at
Iulis that the ox to be saerificed to Dionysus should be killed
with an axe by a boy. The festival being near, the axe had
been sent t.o be repaired, and Simonides, who was then a lad,
was sent off to the blacksmith‘s to feteh it. Finding the inan
asleep and his bellows and tongs lying 011 1110 ground eud to
end, he returned to his companions and put to them the
above conundrum. For the ‘father of 1110 kid‘ is the
bessows, the ‘fell fish' the ⁴ crab' or tongs, ‘ the child of eve '
sleep, and ‘ Baechus' buteher-knight' the axe. There is
another pieee by Simonides which puzzles readers who do not
know the story :
