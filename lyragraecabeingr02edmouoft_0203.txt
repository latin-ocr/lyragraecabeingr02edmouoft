Herodian Oti Incorrect Spevflz : There is a difference be-
tween ’γῆμαι ‘to marry' and ’γήμασθαι ‘to give oneself in

Etymoloqz'cum Mannum : κνύζα, according to Herodian, if it
means the plant ‘Fleabanes is a shortening . . . but if it
means ‘spoilt or defiled‘ it eomes from κνύω ‘to scratch '—

lechery.4

Zonaras [on πανδοκεῖον ‘ inn '] ε . . . the form μοχλός ‘ bolt’
with a χ is used equally iu Attio, Doric, and Ionio, save for
Anacreon, who is practically alone in spelling it with a κ,
though Zenodotus would change it to a χε

He sleeps untroubled though he never drew bolt
in his house-door.5
