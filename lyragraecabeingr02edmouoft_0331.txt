SIMONIDES
62-64

Plutarch Lzsfe qf Theseus: And then, while Theseus cheered
his father and boasted how he would va-nqnish the Miuotaur,
Aegeus gave the ship’s captain a spare white sail, bidding
him hoist- the white if he came home with Theseus saved
alive, and if not, to sail with the black in token of what, had
happened. But according to Simonides the sail given by
Aegeus was not white, bnt:

a crimson sail dyed with the flowei· of the
springing holin-Oak

and Aegeus made this their token that all was well. The
captain of the ship was

Phereclus son of Amarsyas
according to Simonides.

Scholiast on Sophocles [⁵ What is it you have left undone ⁴2⁷ ¹]
that is, what is wanting or lacking to yon for this your need?
‘ what is lacking' means that it would have been better for
him to come a moment sooner3 and in Simonides of the
messenger sent to Aegeus:

Ι would have given thee reward more worth than
life itself‚ hadst thou got hither sooner.

Clement of Alexandria: God preaehes to ns and Him we
must- believe: ‘ For with the heart man believeth nnto
righteonsness, and with the mouth confession is made nnto
salvation. For the scripture saith “ XVhosoever believeth οη
him shall not be put to shame.’⁷⁷ (Rom. 10. 10). Well may
Simonides write:

¹ Soph. prob. wrote (pleonastically) τί δ’ ἐστι χρείας τοῦθ’
ὑπεσπανισμένον,· χρείας going with τι’; Jebb⁴s translation
cannot be got out of his text (Ε)
