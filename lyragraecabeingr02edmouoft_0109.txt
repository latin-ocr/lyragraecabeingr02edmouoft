Aelian Natural H {story [on the snake called dipsas] ε Ι must

fain charm this beast with a tale, and therefore I will not· ἓ ⁷ ἶ ’ ἶ

withhold one I have heard, lest I be thought to be ignorant
of it. Report hath it that Prometheus stole the fire, and
this tale says that Zeus flew into a rage and gave those who
told him of the theft a charm to avert old age. I understand
that the recipients of this charm put it upon an ass, and the
ass went on before with his pack, and growing thirsty—for
it was summertime -betook himself to a spring to get him
drink. But the snake that guarded that spring checked his
advance, aud would have driven him off had he not twisted
his head about and bought his friendship with the only gift
he had to hand, the charm he carried on his back. The
bargain is struck. The ass drinks; the snake sloughs his
old age, receiving, they say, the ass's thirst to boot. Well
now; is this tale of my own making? No, Ι cannot claim
that for mine which was told before me by Sophocles the
tragedy-writcr‚ Deinolochus the rival of Epicharmus, Ibycus
of Rhegium, aud Aristeas and Apollophanes the writers of
comedy.
