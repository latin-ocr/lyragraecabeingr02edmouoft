VICTORY-SONGS FOR THE FOUR-
HORSE-CHARIOT-RACE

401

Aristophanes an'ylzls: [CHORUS to CLEON] : O how I wish
you might tiu-ow up your mouthful ² as readily as you found
it. Then, it ever, should Ι sing

Drink, O drink when things go right3

and Ι believe that the man from Iulis, being an old chap
with an eye for the—loaves‚³ would have sung his Han-to-
Apollo’s and Great-God-of-Wine’s with a right good will
for the occasion.

Scholiast οη llic passaye: He means: Then Ι should sing
you Simonides’ song ‘Drink’ etc.: the song comes from
Simonides’ Four-Horsc-Cleariot-Race &my-s, and the word
συμφορά [which usually means ‘lnisfortune’l is here used of
good luck. For it is really colourless [meaning an event}

414 Fon XENOCRATES oF AGRlGENTUM

Scholiast on Pindar Introduction 1³0 Pythian I: This Xeno-
crates won in the horse-sace not only ab the Isthinian
Festival, but at the Pythian iu the ‘24th Pythiad (13.0. 490)
according to Aristotle's list. Simonides includes both the
victories in his celebration of the victor.

42 Fon Οηιιωε

Diogenian Presace to Prorerbs z A ‘ Carian tale ' is one
which is told of a Carian fisherman who said when he saw an
octfopus onc winter's day ‘ If I strip and dive for him Ι shall
catch cold, and if I don't take him my children will die of
hunger? Timocreon uses this story in his Lyric Poems, and
Simonides refers to it in his Epinicicm Odesor Orillas.
