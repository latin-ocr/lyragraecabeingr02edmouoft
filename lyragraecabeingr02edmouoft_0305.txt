SIMONIDES

26
Stobaeus Autholossy [That life is short, of little account,
and full of care] : From the Diryes of Simonides :

For even they that were of old time and were
born half-immortal sons of most high Gods, came
not unto old age without toil, nor without the malice
of men, nor without peril.

271

Dionysius of Halicarnassus [On verse composition which
greatly resembles prose]: Take from the lyric poetry this
of Simonides, which is here written2 with the pause-marks
corresponding nou to the metrica] lines arranged by Aristo-
phanes of Byzantium or another, but to the requirements of
the words treated as prose. Pray consider the poem and
read this part οἱ it according to the pause-nrirks, and you
may be quite sure that the ihythm of the poem will escape
you and y ou will be unable to piek out strophe, antistiophe,
οι· epode; the poem will appeai to you mere prose. It is
