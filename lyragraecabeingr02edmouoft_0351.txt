SIMONIDES
97

Stobaeus slsetlzolosfry [That Life is short, of little account
and full of care] ε Simonides : ¹

But there's one saying of the man of Chios 2 which
passcs all, ‘ The life of man is even as the life of a
green leaf' ; yet few that receive it with the ear lay it
away in the breast ; for there's a hope which springeth
in every heart that is young, and so long as man
possesseth the flowery bloom of youth there is much
that his light heart deems to have no end, counting
neither on age nor death, and taking no thought for
sickness in time of health. Poor fools they to think
so, aud not to know that the time of youth and life
is but short for such as be mortal! Wherefore be
thou wise in time, and fail not when the end is near
to give thy soul freely of the best.

Plutarch Lelter os consolation to Apollonius: For as Simonides
say s:

A thousand, aye, ten thousand 3ears are but a
point one cannot see, nay the smallest part of a
point.
