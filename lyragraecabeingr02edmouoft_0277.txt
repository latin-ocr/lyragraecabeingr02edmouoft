LIFE OF SIMONIDES

Aristotle Illetaplqzssics: All these things are irra-
tional, and inconsistent both with one another and
with what is rational, and we may apply to them the
term ‘a long story’ as it is used by Simonides, a
long story in that sense being the kind of account
given by a slave when he will not talk sense.

Alexander of Aphrodisias οη lhe passage: These
words will be clear to any reader who has been told
what is meant by the λόγος of Simonides. This
writer, in what he calls his ’Άτακτοι Λόγοι or I'rose
Camers-astons} imitates [that is, gives a literary repre-
sentation of] the answers eri-ing slaves will generally
make when their masters are enquiring why they have
blundered, and makes them give extremely long and
verbose excuses which have no sense—that is, plausi-
bility—-but are entirely off the point. This would seem
to be characteristic of foreign birth and lac-k of educa-
tion.

Pindar Olympicum : Skilled is the man who knoweth
much by nature3 they that have but learnt—even as
a pair of crows, gl uttonons in their wordiness, these
chatter vain things against the divine bird of Zeus.

Scholiast on the passage: He hints at Bacchylides
and Simonides, calling himself an eagle and his
rivals crows.2

Scholiast onPindar: . . . Simonides often employs
digression.

Eustathius Introduction to {he Commenhoys on Pimlar :
lt is said that Pindar was a pupil also of Simonides.
