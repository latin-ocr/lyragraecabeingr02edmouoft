SIMONIDES

1631

Plutarch Malc'gmz'ly of Herodotus: The offerings dedicated
in the temple oi' Leto by Diodorus, 0116 of the Corinthian
commanders, bear the following inscription² ε

These arms of the Medes whom they sank in the
sea the crew of Diodorus dedicated to Leto as 3
memorial of the sea-sight.

164³

The Same: And then shall we believe what he says about
3 single individual or state, when in one word he robs
Greece of 1116 victory, destroys the trophy, and damns as
mere boasting and bluff the inscription the Athenians dedi-
cated to Artemis of 1116 East? The inscription runs thus :

When the host of the Mede was destroyed, the
sons of Athens defeated tribes of all manner of men
from Asia in 3 fight upon this sea, and dedicated
these tokens 111110 1116 Virgin Artemis.4

The Same: It becomes clear that his object in eoncocting
this 116 was not to praise Democritus but 10 51131116 1116
Naxians, when we remark that he has passed over without
3 word the success of Democritus and the distinguished
service indicated by the Inscription⁵ of Simonides:

. . . Democritus, as one of the three that com-
manded the fight when the Greeks fought the
Medes on the sea off Salamis, took five ships from
1116 foe, and for a sixth seat saved Dorisss from falling
into Barbarian hands.

4 ref. to Artemisium ⁵ more likely 311 Elegiae poem, but
they may have formed a single Book with the l'nscr'z‘ptz'ons
