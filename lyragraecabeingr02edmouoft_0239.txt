music, and made the dithyramb c01npetitive3 he
also introduced quibbles.1

Athenaeus Doctors a! Diuum· [on fish] : I know 100
1116 5311165 of Lasus of Hermione 011 this subject, 35
given by Chamaeleon of Heraclea in his Act-0101! of
Lasns, where he says: ‘ Lasus used to dec-lare that
raw fish was ὀπτός ‘ cooked,‘ and when, as many
people did, his interlocutor showed his amazement,
he tried to make out that since what is to be heard
is ἀκουστός 01· ‘ audible’ and what is to be thought is
νοητός or ‘conceivable‚’ therefore, since a fish is to be
seen, it is ὀπτός or ‘ 11511116 ’ [11111611 3150 means
‘ cooked ’]. And one day, by way of a joke, 116
purloined a fish from some fishernien, and gave it 10
one of the bystanders, and then took a solemn oath
that he neither had it himself nor knew that anybody
else had taken it3 which 116 was able to do because
he had taken it himself and another 111311 had it, and
this man had 1115 instructions to 511631· 11131 116 neither
had taken it himself nor knew that anybodjv else had
it—which he in like manner could do because he had
it and Lasus had taken it.

Plutarch False Shame: This (1156356, 111611, being
the cause of man}v ills, it 116110165 115 10 eradicate by
treatment. . . . Suppose, for instance‚a fellow-guest
asks you to play dice 0161· the wine. Do not be put
out of eouutenance or be afraid you are being made
fun of, but imitate Xenophanes, who when Lasus of
Hermione called him a coward for refusing to play
dice with 111111, agreed that lie was a coward, and a
great coward, over unseeinly things.²

when he pleaded that the stakes were small, rejoined ‘ Ah !
but not the habit’
