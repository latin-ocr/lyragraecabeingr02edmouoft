STESICHORUS

beast, the fellow severs the creature with the aforesaid
sickle and thereby frees the eagle from his hopeless bondage.
His unlooked for task accomplished, the countryman filled
his pitcher, and going back, mixed the wine and handed it
round to the company, who all drained both their first cups
before the meal and many more along with it, he biding his
turn, being for that time as it happened servingnian and not
guest. But no sooner had he raised cup to lip, than the
eagle he had saved, being as luck would have it still near
by and willing to make him good return for his service,
swoops on the cup, knocks it over, and wastes the drink.
The poor fellow, who had been very thirsty‚ cried out in
anger, ‘You are the bird I saved ³—for he recognised him-
‘and is this your gratitudo? Here's a foul end to a fair
deed 2 How shall any inan now trouble himself for another
out of sear of the God of thanks?' As he spoke he grew
still thirstier‚ when turning about lle sees his comrades that
had drunk gasping in the article of death. It seems that the
snake had voided his vomit 111 the spring and fouled it with
his venom, and the eagle had returned like with like and
saved his saviour.

Crates of Pergamum declares that this tale is told in a
little-known poem of Stesichorus, which in my opinion is
high and ancient authority.
