LIFE OF SACADAS

the competition instituted by the Amphictyons
before it was a crown-contest and twice after the
change had been made. .

Plutarch Music 12 : There is something to be said
too in the matter of rhythms . . . Polymnastus, who
followed Terpander, employed new rhythms as well
as his, but preserved throughout the same beautiful
style3 and the like is true of Thaletas and Saeadas,
who showed powers of invention in the rhythmic art
without exceeding the limits of the beautiful style
they inherited.

Pollux Vocabulcmjzs: The Nomes of Olympus and
Marsyas are the I’lzrzsgian and the Lydum, that of
Sacadas the Byllzia11‚ those of Euius the (ᾗχι-[ἱρὴ. and
those of Olympus (the youngerP) Iz'pitfflnbidimz or

The Same: The Pythian Flute-Nome has five
parts, the Trial, the Clzallenge, the lumbics, the
Spondaics, and the Dance of Trimnplt. It is a repre-
sentation (in music) of the sight between Apollo
and the Serpent. In the Tria( Apollo looks about
him to see if the place is suitable for the struggle,
in the Challenge he calls the Serpent to come on,
in the [ambies he fights him. The Invenies include
passages for the trumpet and one to be played
through the teeth, this representing the gnashing
of the Serpent when he is piereed with the arrows.
The Spomlaics depict the victory of the God, and in
the last of the five parts he danees triumphant.1
