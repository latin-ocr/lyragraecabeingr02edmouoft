Plutarch jficlzynitgs of Herodotus [after 123] z The eenotaph

The Same [after 124]: And indeed Adeimantus himself,
whom Herodotus always muligns most bitterly, and particu-
larly in saying that he was the only general who resisted
(Themistocles) with a view to making his escape from
Artemisium, pray consider what fame he afterwards enjoyed :

This is the tomb of that Adeimantus, through
whose counsels Greece put on the crown of freedom.³

Palatina Antholossy: Simonides:

These erowned their dear country with fame
inextinguishable by wrapping round them the mist
and gloom of death3 though they died they are not
dead, for their valour brings them back in glory
from the world below.

also Aristid. 2. 512 <among other poems of SA, who adds
from a less trustworthy tradition ‘[saved all Greece] froin
slavery, and fastening all manner of woe upon the proud
Persians made them to relneinber a grievous fight at sea.
Our bones lie in Salamis, but our fatherland of Corinth hath
set up this memorial in return for the good deed we did’
