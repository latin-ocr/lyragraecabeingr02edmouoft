ANACREON

75 ¹
Athenaeus Doetors at Dz'nner [on mixing wine]: It was
formerly the custom to pour into the cup first the water and
then the wine . . . Compare Anacreon:
Bring water, lad, bring wine, bring me garlands
of flowers; aye, bring them hither3 for I would try
a bout with Love.

762

Thef Same [on the sainc]: In Anacreon it is one of wine to
two o water:

Come bring me a jar, lad; I want my first-drink 3
ten ladles of water to five of wine, for 1 would e'en
play the Bacchanal in decent wise ;

and proceeding he calls the drinking of wine umnixed a
Scythian practice :

Come let us give up this Scythiam drinking with
uproar and din over our cups, and drink moderately
between pretty songs of praise.3

Scholiast on Hesiod [⁴01⁸ the infernal God’]: The word
χθόνιος ‘ infernal’ is used for στυγερύς ¹ hateful οι· wretched ’
as in Anacreon:

and I kept myself sec1·etive.4
