STESICHORUS

Suidas Laricon: παλινοδία z—:i return journey; but
παλινῳδία means a return or counter song, or saying
the opposite to what one has said3 the verb is
παλινῳδῶ ; and there is a proverb ‘ singiug a palinode
or recantation.'

Macarius P1·overl).s·; Stesichorus sings a palinode:
used of those who change their minds for the better.

Suidas Lericon: The three of Stesichorum——
strophe, antistrophe, and epode3 because all the
poetry of Stesichorus was epodic. And when the
ancients wanted to abuse an uncultivated man they
said that he didn't know even the three of
Stesichorus
