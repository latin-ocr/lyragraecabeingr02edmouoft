THE POEMS OF ANACREON
Boon Ι

12 To Anrmns

Hephaestion 072 Pocms t A poem is known as ‘common in
form ' when it is made up of two ‘systexns’ or stanzas like
the first poem of Anacreon ε

To thee l kneel,3 thou shooter of deer, flaxen-
haired child of Zeus, Artemis queen of wild beasts,
who now doubtless lookest down rejoicing beside the
eddies of Lethaeus upon a city of valiant hearts; for
thou art shepherd to no savage flock of lnen.4

For although according to the edition now in use the
strophe has eight lines and the poem consists of a single
strophe, this strophe cau also bc separated into a three-
group and a five-gronp, so that a Pherecratic ends both the
three-line and the four-line systelns.5

nesia the poem is prob. complete ; see however Kehrhahn
Herm. 1914 ⁵ does not necessarily imply that l. 3 ended
in the Aristarchean (?) edition in θηρίων, but prob. that there
was no division-mark put betw. ll. 3 and 4
