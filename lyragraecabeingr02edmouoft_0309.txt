SIMONIDES
29

Plutarch Lelter qs C'mzsolation to Apollonius: For Simonides
says:

Little is man's strength and his cares unavaihng,
and 'tis toil upon toil for him in a life that is short3
for all he can do, there's a death hangs over him
that will not be escaped, in which both good men
and bad must share alike.

Athenaeus Doctors at Dinnefs- [on the word ’γαλαθηνός
‘suckling']: And in another passage Simonides says of
Archemorus :

They wept as the suckling babe of violet-crowned
Eurydice breathed out its sweet soul.

31

Diogenes Laertius [on Cleobulus]: This man eomposed
poenis and riddles to the amount of 3000 lines, and‘is eon·
sidered by some writers to be the author of the Epitaph on
Midas: ‘A maiden of brass am Ι, and I lie on the tonib of
Midas. So long as water shall flow and tall trees grow
green, sun rise and shine and moon give light, rivers run
and sea wash shore, ever shall Ι abido upon this sore-lamentcd
tornb and tell the passers-by that this is the grave of Midas.’
And they find evidence for this in a poem of Simonides,
where he says:

Who that bath understanding would praise Cleo-
bulus the man of Lindus for his pitting of the might
of a gravestone against the ever-running rivers and
the flowers of the Spring, against the flame of sun
and of golden moon, and against the eddies of the
ocean-ware? All these are subject to the Gods;
but a stone, even lnortal hands may break it. This

is the rede of a fool.
