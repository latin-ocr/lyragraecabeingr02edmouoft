SIMONIDES
Lirn

Strabo Geograplzy : Ceos was originally a tetrapolis,
but only two of the four remain as separate cities,
Iulis and Carthaea, 'che former having absorbed
Coresia and the latter Poie'essa. Iulis was the birth-
place of the lyric poet Simonides and of his nephew
Bacchylides, and later of the physician Erasistratus
and the Peripatetic philosopher Ariston . . . There
appears to have been a law here, mentioned by
Menander in the lines ‘The Cean custom takes my
fancy still, Ι The man who can’t live well shall not
live ill‚' whereby, in order to make the supplies go
round, all citizens who had reached the age of sixty
should drink the hemlock.1

Herodotus Hisiories: Following upon ’their track,
the Persians came up with the fij-ing Ionians at
Ephesus, and when they turned and showed fight
inflicted upon them a severe defeat, after which they
put to the sword a number of well-known men, in->
cluding 'che Ereti-ian connnandcr Eualcides, who had
taken the prize at crown—contests in the Games and
been highly eulogised by Simonides of Ceos.

1 hence partly perh. S.’s voluntary exile after middle-age ;
had the law been enforced in his case, niuch of his finest
extant work would never have been done
